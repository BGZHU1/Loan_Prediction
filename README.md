# Loan_Prediction
Using machine learning technic to predict the rate of loan payback

Data_clean:

cleaned the columns had data leakage issue, redundant info ,missing value,null value

converted text varaibles to categorical variables, then to dummy variables

exported the clean dataset as filtered_data


Predict the rate of loan payback: 

developed error matrix

applied cross validation in logistic regression to predict the loan pay-back rate

improved the classifer by maunally imposing the panelty for wrong classifcation


result:

tpr=0.6712295651648384

fpr=0.3923419412288513
